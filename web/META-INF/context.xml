        TechTroveWebApp Context Configuration.
        The context path is typically derived from the WAR file name (e.g., TechTroveWebApp.war -> /TechTroveWebApp)
        or can be explicitly set during deployment or in server-specific descriptors.
        For defining JNDI resources like DataSources for GlassFish,
        it's often preferred to use glassfish-web.xml or the GlassFish Admin Console.
